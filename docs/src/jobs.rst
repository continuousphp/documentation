Working at Continuous
=====================

At Continuous, we are developing solutions for software development
teams. Our aim is to help companies to reduce their time to market by
enabling them to deliver new features as fast as possible to the
market using our Continuous Delivery/Deployment platform:
continuousphp.

We are involved in the development communities. We are passionate
about DevOps practices and want to help other developers to adopt
these concepts.

We are a fast growing startup based in Esch-Belval in the south of
Luxembourg. We have our office in the Technoport business incubator
and benefit from an all-equiped place to work in.

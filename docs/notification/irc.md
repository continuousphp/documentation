## Enable IRC notifications in your pipeline
Simply go to the last step of the Pipeline configuration **Deployment & Notification settings**. There you can enable IRC notifications by choosing it in the list of notification adapters. You just need to provide the server URL, Port and Channel. You can choose to be notified upon build creation, build success or build failure.

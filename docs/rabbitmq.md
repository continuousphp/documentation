[RabbitMQ](https://github.com/rabbitmq) is supported by continuousphp.

## Specification

RabbitMQ containers are available for each activity in your build. To enable one of them, simply add the environment
variable `CPHP_SERVICE_RABBITMQ` with the desired RabbitMQ version as value to your pipeline configuration. Available versions are :

* ***3.7.5***

E.g. if you need `RabbitMQ 3.7.5` in your Behat tests, go to the Testing Settings (step 2 of the Pipeline) and add the
environment variable `CPHP_SERVICE_RABBITMQ = 3.7.5` to the Behat configuration.

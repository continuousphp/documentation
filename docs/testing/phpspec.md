[phpspec](http://phpspec.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is a tool which can help you writing tests designed by specification.

## Installation
You can use phpspec on continuousphp by installing it via composer. Simply add it to your *composer.json* and update your *composer.lock* by running a *composer update*.

```json
"require-dev": {
  "phpspec/phpspec": "~2.4"
}
```

## Configuration
When you create a new pipeline, continuousphp will attempt to configure the tests automatically by looking for *phpspec.yml* or *phpspec.yml.dist* files in your repository. The available test locations will then be listed in the second step of the pipeline configuration. Of course, you can always modify or delete the configuration proposed by continuousphp.
As for all other testing frameworks on continuousphp, you can choose if the tests on phpspec will block the deployment on failure or if the build goes into a warning state if the tests fail.

!!! note "**IMPORTANT:**" 
    You don't need to run phpspec using a shell command or a Phing target. continuousphp takes care of starting the tests for you.

## Executing tasks

You can specify tasks to be executed before running the tests. This can be very useful to initialize external resources like [databases](/databases) or third-party services. Currently continuousphp supports [Phing](https://www.phing.info/), but others will be supported soon (shell commands, ...).

!!! note "**IMPORTANT:**" 
  Tasks can be defined at different places in your workflow:

  1. During the creation of the package to be tested

  2. During the tests

  3. During the creation of the package to be deployed

## Build

As soon as the testing package is created, the tests will start:

![phpspec build start](/assets/doc/testing/phpspec/build-start.png)

![phpspec build end](/assets/doc/testing/phpspec/build-end.png)

## Environment Variables

You can use Environment Variables to configure your testing environment. Simply go to the *Test Settings* (step 2
of the pipeline configuration), open the phpspec configuration and add one or more Environment Variables:

### Encryption

Environment Variables can (optionally) be encrypted. Pay attention that, once a variable is encrypted, you can no longer obtain
it's value. An encrypted Environment Variable can only be decrypted during a build by continuousphp's workers. Encrypted
Environment Variables will be masked in the build output.

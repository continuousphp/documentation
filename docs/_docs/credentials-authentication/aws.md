You can use Micro-Services from AWS on continuousphp. Simply generate an Access Token and Secret
Access Key in [AWS IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) and inject them into your pipeline to
access all the services you need on AWS!

<div class="row panel callout warning clearfix">
  <h2 class="left"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i></h2>
  Our containers are equipped with the latest version of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" target="_blank">AWS Command Line Interface</a>. No need to install it yourself!

The credentials will be injected automatically into each container, so that you can access
Amazon Web Services at each stage of your build. If you want to deploy using
[AWS CodeDeploy](https://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/) or [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/),
take a look at our documentation section on deployment with [AWS CodeDeploy](/_docs/deployment/aws-code-deploy/)
or [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](/_docs/deployment/aws-elastic-beanstalk/)!
